## Fork Updates 

After the repository was archived, webdriver-manager was updated, rendering this script temporarily useless. I fixed the issue for Chrome but haven't tested it with Edge and Firefox yet. If there's demand for those features in the future, I'll look into it. Enjoy the upcoming updates!

## Features

- Multiple Bing Rewards Accounts
- Multi-Threading (Optional)
- PC & Mobile Search Automation
- Bing Quiz, Poll, and Explore Automation
- Quests / Punchcard Automation

## Installation
The bot can be run using Python or Docker.

### Python Script
Run locally:
1. Clone this repository, cd into it, and install dependancies:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prem-ium/BingRewards.git
   cd BingRewards
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. Run the script:
```sh
   python main.py
```
I personally use PM2 to run the python script. Download and read more at: [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)

To run the python script in PM2:

1. Do exactly as above but instead open a cmd where main.py is stored
2. Run the script through pm2 if you have installed it correctly:
```pm2 start main.py
```
3. Run the logs command to see the script output:
```pm2 logs
```
4. If you would like to stop the script run:
```pm2 stop main.py
```

### Docker Container
View on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nelsondane/bing-rewards)
1. Download and install Docker on your system
2. Configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. To start the bot using our prebuilt images:
 ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards nelsondane/bing-rewards:<tag>
   ```
   To build the image yourself, cd into the repository and run:
   ```sh
   docker build -t bing-rewards .
   ```
   Then start the bot with:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards bing-rewards
   ```
   Both methods will create a new container called `bing-rewards`. Make sure you have the correct path to your `.env` file you created.

4. Let the bot log in and begin working. DO NOT PRESS `CTRL-c`. This will kill the container and the bot. To exit the logs view, press `CTRL-p` then `CTRL-q`. This will exit the logs view but let the bot keep running.

You can also open `DockerQuickstart.bat` in a text editor, edit the exisitng path in the file with your own of the BingRewards folder directory and run it to quickly stop and start docker container instances.

## Earning Potential:
The following is a conservatively prediction of potential points/earnings per month using this bot w/ lvl 2 account:

PC Searches: (150 * 30) = 4500

Mobile Searches: (100 * 30) = 3000

Edge Bonus: (20*30) = 600

Daily Sets: (30*30) = 900


This adds up to 9000 points, conservatively (not accounting for streak bonuses or more activities which usually net very high, random amount of points), which ends up being a minimum of $6.92/per month per account on level 2. $41.52/ per month with an instance of 6 conncurrent level 2 reward accounts.

ONLY USE 5 ACCOUNTS PER IP

## Notes:

- This bot uses the new $1.00 = 1300 points conversion rate, which is standard for most US based Bing accounts. Older Bing Reward accounts may have the old conversion rate of $1.00 = 1050 points. As well as â‚¬1.00 = 1500 points conversion rate for Euro based Bing Reward accounts.
- As always, use this bot at your own risk. No developer or contributor to this repository is responsible for any financial or account suspension you may suffer.
